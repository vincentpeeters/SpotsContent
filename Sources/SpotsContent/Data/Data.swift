Morocco’s broad range of climates is also a blessing for trekkers. Whichever you choose, trekking is often the highlight of any visit to Morocco.")

//Why don't more people come to walk in the Rif Mountains? The first and lowest of the mountain ranges that ripple south through Morocco, they make perfect trekking country, blessed as they are with **magnificent ranges, gorges and valleys, clothed in forests of cedar, cork oak and fir.** Being close to the Mediterranean, **the Rif are also the greenest of Morocco's mountains and springtime, with its riot of wildflowers, is one of the most delightful times to walk here.** You are also likely to meet troupes of Barbary apes around the edge of Talassemtane National Park.

//            There are numerous trekking opportunities of various durations in the vast 580-sq-km Talassemtane National Park, which begins just outside Chefchaouen. The name means ‘cold spring’ in Berber. Some popular destinations include the small villages of El Kelaâ and Akchour, and God’s Bridge, a natural formation that looks like a stone arch. The duration of these excursions depends on how much you wish to drive versus walk.
//            Skip the better-known High Atlas trails and head instead to the Rif Mountains, where Berber mule tracks snake through cedar forests in the Talassemtane National Park. With a bird’s eye view of the Mediterranean, these are the greenest mountains in Morocco, the slopes covered with cultivated kif (cannabis) and a muddle of Mediterranean herbs. **The best treks spin out from the bluewashed mountain village of Chefchaouen and wend past limestone crags and stone villages**. Berbers originally reigned here but many battles have since raged between colonizers and bandits. Locals will as likely shout out ‘hola’ as ‘bonjour’ or ‘salaam’. Prettier than the Atlas mountains, the area is quite picturesque – the villages are lived in, laundry drapes over hedges and chickens chase at your heels – but sitting peaceably in the sunshine, munching fresh walnuts and looking out over the hills it’s remarkable so few venture here.
